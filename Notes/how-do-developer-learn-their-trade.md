# How do developer learn their trade?

There are many ways a developer learns how to do their job.

One important one in the context of these conversations is feedback.

The reason humans are so successful is our ability to collaborate.

Humans, and, by association, developers, are social creatures. I don't mean we are all extraverts, but that large swaths of our brains are dedicated to interpreting the thoughts and intentions of others. We are fine-tuned to be able to navigate a social group and work to be accepted by that group.

So, when we act within a group, we watch out for approval. One's status within a group is critical, and necessary for getting support and building relationships.
