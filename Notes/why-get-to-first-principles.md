# Why get to first principles

I stated I would like to agree on some axioms to help build an argument for TDD. In this context, by axioms, what I really mean are those claims that anyone who is a professional developer would agree upon. If we are arguing based on 2 different assumptions, we are probably arguing about 2 different things.

Damien asked why? What are we trying to achieve?

I would like to learn the art of TDD, and writing 'Quality Code' by getting to first principles.

I want to have a level of certainty that what I am trying to do has value.

Am I trying to persuade other people to do code a certain way, and want to know all the arguments against it?

Am I trying to be 'right'?
