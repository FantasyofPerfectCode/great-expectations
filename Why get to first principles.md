I stated I would like to agree on some axioms to help build an argument for TDD. 
Damien asked why? What are we trying to achieve?

I would like to learn the art of TDD, and writing 'Quality Code' by getting to first principles. 
I want to have a level of certainty that what I am trying to do has value. 
I want to understand the learning journey other people have taken to get to their views.
